        <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
        <p>I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within your organization. With more than twenty years of experience in the legal industry and a growing academic foundation in information technology, I offer a unique blend of professional discipline, customer service, and technical proficiency. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background, skill set, and enthusiasm for learning can contribute to your team.
        <br><br>

        Throughout my legal career, I developed strengths that translate directly into the technology field, including reliability, teamwork, attention to detail, and the ability to manage multiple priorities accurately and efficiently. These experiences have shaped my approach to problem-solving and have prepared me to adapt quickly to new tools, environments, and challenges.
        <br><br>

        I hold an Associate of Science in Computer Information Systems and am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Science, with an expected graduation date of May 2026. My technical skills include Java, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and PL/SQL. I am experienced with development and version control tools such as Eclipse, Visual Studio, and GitHub, and I am familiar with Linux (Ubuntu), Oracle environments, and relational database management systems.
        <br><br>

        I believe the combination of my professional experience and ongoing technical training positions me well to support your organization’s goals. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about how I can contribute to your team. I can be reached at (562) 895-1981 and am available at your convenience.</p>
